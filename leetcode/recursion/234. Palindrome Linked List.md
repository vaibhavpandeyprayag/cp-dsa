# 234. Palindrome Linked List (Easy)

_Given the head of a singly linked list, return true if it is a palindrome._

### **Constraints:**

_The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 105].  
 0 <= Node.val <= 9_

### **Testcases:**

## Approach:

Palindrome means anything which is same whether read from left to right or right to left.

We need 2 pointers - **forwardNode** (moving towards right) and **backwardNode** (moving towards left).
Using recursive calls, the **backwardNode** gets to the end of linkedlist. From there the comparison between **forwardNode** and **backwardNode** starts. **forwardNode** is moved to right by one step in every recursive call and **backwardNode** moves to left as the control returns to previous recursive call, thus resulting in comparison of first and last node, second and second-last node and so on.

_**Time Complexity: O(n)** as the linkedlist is traversed.  
**Space Complexity: O(1)** as no extra space was required._

## Code:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* forwardNode;

    bool helper(ListNode* backwardNode) {
        if (backwardNode == NULL) return true;
        bool palindrome = helper(backwardNode->next) && (forwardNode->val == backwardNode->val);
        forwardNode = forwardNode->next;
        return palindrome;
    }

    bool isPalindrome(ListNode* head) {
        forwardNode = head;
        return helper(head);
    }
};
```
