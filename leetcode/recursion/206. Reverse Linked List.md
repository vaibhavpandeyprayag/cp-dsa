# 206. Reverse Linked List (Easy)

_Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list._

### **Constraints:**

_The number of nodes in the list is the range [0, 5000].  
-5000 <= Node.val <= 5000_

### **Testcases:**

## Approach:

We get to the end of the linkedlist by recursion. Since the last node will be the head of reversed linkedlist, we assign a pointer **newHead** to it. Now at every recursive call we need to remember the current node so as to set its next node to previous node (thus linking the nodes in reverse order), so we assign a pointer **itr** to the current node **node**. As every recursive call returns, the current node **node** is the previous node and the next of **itr** is set to **node** thus reversing the linkedlist; this **node** is then set as **itr** for further relinking. After this procedure is completed, return **newHead**.

_**Time Complexity: O(n)** where n is the length of the linkedlist; as the linkedlist is traversed.  
**Space Complexity: O(1)** as no extra space was required; all the nodes were relinked as stated in the problem._

## Code:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* newHead;
    ListNode* itr;
    void helper(ListNode* node) {
        if (node->next == NULL) {
            newHead = node;
            itr = node;
            return;
        }
        helper(node->next);
        itr->next = node;
        itr = itr->next;
        node->next = NULL;
    }

    ListNode* reverseList(ListNode* head) {
        if (head == NULL) return NULL;
        helper(head);
        return newHead;
    }
};
```
