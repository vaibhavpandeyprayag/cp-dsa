# 344. Reverse String (Easy)

_Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.  
You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory._

### **Constraints:**

_1 <= s.length <= 105  
s[i] is a printable ascii character._

### **Testcases:**

Example 1:

- Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]  
  Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]

Example 2:

- Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]  
  Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]

## Approach:

Reverse means what is first becomes last, second becomes second-last and so on. Hence we need to apply two pointer approach where one pointer (**start**) points to first letter and the other one (**end**) points to last letter.

A function is called with initial parameters - **vector s**, **int start = 0** and **int end = s.size() - 1**.  
At every recursive call, we swap letters pointed by the pointers, **start** pointer is increased by 1 and **end** pointer is decreased by 1.  
Once the pointers meet each other (**start >= end**), we do need futher swaps, otherwise the letters will get back to their original place.

_**Time Complexity: O(n)** as the given vector is traversed and swapping costs only O(1) time complexity.  
**Space Complexity: O(1)** as no extra space was required._

## Code:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void helper(vector<char>& s, int start, int end) {
        if (start >= end) return;
        char temp = s[start];
        s[start] = s[end];
        s[end] = temp;
        helper(s, start + 1, end - 1);
    }
    void reverseString(vector<char>& s) {
        helper(s, 0, s.size() - 1);
    }
};
```
