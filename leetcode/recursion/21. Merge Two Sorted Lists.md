# 21. Merge Two Sorted Lists (Easy)

_You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2.  
Merge the two lists in a one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.  
Return the head of the merged linked list._

### **Constraints:**

_The number of nodes in both lists is in the range [0, 50].  
-100 <= Node.val <= 100  
Both list1 and list2 are sorted in non-decreasing order._

## Approach:

We traverse the lists from left to right,  
check which one of the two nodes from list1 and list2 is smaller/greater than the other:

- **1** of list1 <= **1** of list2  
   so we set next of list1(1) to the head of a sorted list which comprises of rest of the nodes and return the current node.

**Then**

- **2** of list1 >= **1** of list2  
  so we set next of list2(1) to the head of a sorted list which comprises of rest of the nodes and return the current node.

The above two points illustrate the recursive behaviour of our solution.

This process goes on until one of the list has been traversed completely.  
At this step, we simply return the remaining list (no comparision needed as the lists are sorted in themselves).

![Explanation2](/images/leetcode-21mergeTwoSortedLists-explanation2.jpg)

The recursive steps do backtracking, forming a sorted list.

_**Time Complexity: O(n + m)** where n and m are the sizes of list1 and list2 respectively; since we traverse both the lists.  
**Space Complexity: O(1)** as no extra space was required; all the nodes where relinked as stated in the problem._

## Code:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* mergeTwoLists(ListNode* list1, ListNode* list2) {
        if (list1 == NULL) return list2;
        if (list2 == NULL) return list1;

        if (list2->val <= list1->val) {
            list2->next = mergeTwoLists(list1, list2->next);
            return list2;
        }
        else {
            list1->next = mergeTwoLists(list1->next, list2);
            return list1;
        }
    }
};
```
